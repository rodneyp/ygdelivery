Bugs

    * parsing some dates gives N/A

    * only tested for some display mode of the index and message page
          o test expanded display mode
          o test topic view mode

Future

    * embeddable into freecycle mod extension
    * add yui compontents
    * logging for debugging
    * packaging
    * auto-update
    * chrome for control panel, info, etc.
    * unit tests to allow regression and code cleanup
    * colorize header lines by isp/company (y! purple, etc.)
    * control panel to select settings
    * cache page lookup to avoid refetching the same headers over and over

Possible Y!Groups Code Updates

    * clean xml page for raw message format without other markup of headers
    * same sort of thing, but allow a batch of message numbers to fetch several messages in one html requestâ€”for index page markup
